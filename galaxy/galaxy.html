    <h2>Galaxies, explained</h2>
        <p>Galaxies are sprawling systems of dust, gas, dark matter, and anywhere from a million to a trillion stars that are held together by gravity. Nearly all large galaxies are thought to also contain supermassive black holes at their centers. In our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the sun is just one of about 100 to 400 billion stars that spin around Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole that contains as much mass as four million suns.
            The deeper we look into the cosmos, the more galaxies we see. One 2016 study estimated that the observable universe contains two trillion—or two million million—galaxies. Some of those distant systems are similar to our own Milky Way galaxy, while others are quite different.
        </p>
    <h2>Types of galaxies</h2>
            <p>
                Located at the centre of the solar system and influencing the motion of all the other bodies through its gravitational force is the Sun, which in itself contains more than 99 percent of the mass of the system. The planets, in order of their distance outward from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Four planets—Jupiter through Neptune—have ring systems, and all but Mercury and Venus have one or more moons. Pluto had been officially listed among the planets since it was discovered in 1930 orbiting beyond Neptune, but in 1992 an icy object was discovered still farther from the Sun than Pluto. Many other such discoveries followed, including an object named Eris that appears to be at least as large as Pluto. It became apparent that Pluto was simply one of the larger members of this new group of objects, collectively known as the Kuiper belt. Accordingly, in August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the organization charged by the scientific community with classifying astronomical objects, voted to revoke Pluto’s planetary status and place it under a new classification called dwarf planet. For a discussion of that action and of the definition of planet approved by the IAU, see planet.

    <h2>Galactic clusters and mergers</h2>
        <p>Some galaxies occur alone or in pairs, but they are more often parts of larger associations known as groups, clusters, and superclusters. Our Milky Way, for instance, is in the Local Group, a galaxy group about 10 million light-years across that also includes the Andromeda galaxy and its satellites. The Local Group and its neighbor galaxy cluster, the Virgo Cluster, both lie within the larger Virgo Supercluster, a concentration of galaxies that stretches about 100 million light-years across. The Virgo Supercluster, in turn, is a limb of Laniakea, an even bigger supercluster of 100,000 galaxies that astronomers defined in 2014.
            Galaxies in clusters often interact and even merge together in a dynamic cosmic dance of interacting gravity. When two galaxies collide and intermingle, gases can flow towards the galactic center, which can trigger phenomena like rapid star formation. Our own Milky Way will merge with the Andromeda galaxy in about 4.5 billion years.Because elliptical galaxies contain older stars and less gas than spiral galaxies, it seems that the galaxy types represent part of a natural evolution: As spiral galaxies age, interact, and merge, they lose their familiar shapes and become elliptical galaxies. But astronomers are still working out the specifics, such as why elliptical galaxies follow certain patterns in brightness, size, and chemical composition.

    <h2>Our Galaxy: Milky Way</h2> 
       <p>If you’re on a dark countryside hill some night, look up at the sky. Arcing overhead, a faint band of light may appear that looks like milk spilled across the sky. The ancient Romans called the band via lacteal, which means “milky road” or “milky way.”
        The band of light that you see isn’t actually milk, of course—it’s a galaxy. A galaxy is a huge bunch of stars clustered together in space. Our solar system—which includes the sun, Earth, and seven other planets—is part of this galaxy, called … you guessed it … the Milky Way.
        The Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of stars like our sun. (And like our sun, most of these stars have at least one planet orbiting them.) Earth is located about halfway between the center of the Milky Way and its outer edge.
        Light at the galaxy’s center takes 25,000 light-years to travel from Earth. (A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.) So that means if you could see the core of the Milky Way, you’d be observing light that possibly left Earth before humans first settled in North America.
        At the center of the Milky Way is one of the strangest and deadliest things in the universe: a black hole. Black holes are born when a giant star runs out of energy. The star implodes, causing an explosion called a supernova. The star’s heart collapses under its own weight. It’s squashed into a tiny dot you can’t see.
        Scientists suspect a black hole lurks at the center of most galaxies. The Milky Way’s black hole is called Sagittarius A*. (A* is scientist-code for “A-star.”) Its gravity, or attractive force, is so strong that it pulls in anything that gets too close, including stars. So we’re lucky that Earth is located far away from the center!

    <ol><p class="p11">1. Earth has never been perfectly round. The planet bulges around the equator by an extra 0.3 percent as a result of the fact that it rotates about its axis. Earth's diameter from North to South Pole is 12,714 kilometers (7,900 miles), while through the equator it is 12,756 kilometers (7,926 miles). The difference — 42.78 kilometers (26.58 miles) — is about 1/300th the diameter of Earth. More on <a href="/earth/earth.html" style="color: rgb(0, 195, 255);">Earth</a></p></ol>
    <ol><p class="p11">2. The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth.

    <ol><p class="p11">3. Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets. Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We're in one of the galaxy's four spiral arms.

    <ol><p class="p11">4. A significant portion of the universe comprises enigmatic entities: dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter, constituting around 85% of the universe's mass, remains elusive, escaping detection by conventional telescopes. Yet, its gravitational influence molds the cosmic structures we observe. Dark energy, comprising roughly 68% of the universe's energy density, perplexes scientists further. Its existence propels the accelerated expansion of the universe, an astonishing revelation that challenges our understanding of fundamental cosmic forces.
